  "description": "During lockdown, I started to donate home-cooked vegetable soup to people who were not able to get the help or the nutrition that they needed. People loved the recipes, and so Lucy's Ladle was born! I sell nourishing vegetable soups and stews, cooked fresh to order and delivered to your door."
