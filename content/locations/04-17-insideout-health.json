  "safetyTips": "Our gloved delivery drivers are the only two people handling delivery boxes and bags, and we have a maximum of three team members at any time in store with no access for customers. We are able to handle goods as little as possible (just one person picking your order) and our cleaning and hygiene regime is to the extreme (especially when Lucia is in!).",
